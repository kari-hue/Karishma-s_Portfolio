# Customer Segmentation - Python and Machine Learning
This is a complete end to end machine learning project accomplished by analyzing a dataset that is based on transaction taken form a UK-based retailer. The dataset is present in [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). The primary objective of the project is to amplify the efficiency of marketing strategies and boost sales through <b>Customer Segmentation</b>. For this purpose,I used the concept of <b>K-Means Clustering</b> algorithm.

## Task accomplished in this project

* <b>Data cleaning & Tranformation</b> : Data cleaning has been done by handling missing values,duplicates, and outliers, preparing it for the effective clustering.
* <b> Feature Engineering </b>: New features has been created based on the transactional data to create a customer-centric dataset, setting the foundation for customer segmentation. For e.g. Calculating recency by using the current date and last purchased date of the customer, calculating seasonality and trends
* <b> Data preprocessing </b>: Undertook feature scaling and dimensionality reduction to streamline the data enhancing the efficiency of the clustering process.
* <b> Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering</b>: The customers are segmented into distinct groups using K-means, facilitating targeted marketing and personalized strategies.
* <b> Cluster Analysis & Evaluation</b>: Analyze and profile of each cluster to develop targeted markting strategies and assess the quality of the clusters formed.
