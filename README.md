# Customer Segmentation - <a href="[#the-header](https://github.com/kari-hue/MachineLearningModels/blob/main/Customer%20Segmentation/Customer%20Segmentation%20(1).ipynb)">Link to the project</a>

This is a complete end to end machine learning project accomplished by analyzing a dataset that is based on transaction taken form a UK-based retailer. The dataset is present in [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail). The primary objective of the project is to amplify the efficiency of marketing strategies and boost sales through <b>Customer Segmentation</b>. For this purpose,I used the concept of <b>K-Means Clustering</b> algorithm.

## Task accomplished in this project

* <b>Data cleaning & Tranformation</b> : Data cleaning has been done by handling missing values,duplicates, and outliers, preparing it for the effective clustering.
* <b> Feature Engineering </b>: New features has been created based on the transactional data to create a customer-centric dataset, setting the foundation for customer segmentation. For e.g. Calculating recency by using the current date and last purchased date of the customer, calculating seasonality and trends
* <b> Data preprocessing </b>: Undertook feature scaling and dimensionality reduction to streamline the data enhancing the efficiency of the clustering process.
* <b> Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering</b>: The customers are segmented into distinct groups using K-means, facilitating targeted marketing and personalized strategies.
* <b> Cluster Analysis & Evaluation</b>: Analyze and profile of each cluster to develop targeted markting strategies and assess the quality of the clusters formed.

## Inference

We can infer and draw some conclusions about the clusters:

* Cluster 0: From the observation, we can see that the customer belongs to this cluster
-  Tend to do hourly shopping(active during some hrs of the time), frequent buyers 
-  They are low spenders but buy diverse products, and their purchase pattern is also frequent. -impulse buyers

We can quote them as "Hourly buying customers" - Push low-value fast-moving products to lure these customers, increase flash sales or some hourly sale campaign, and target these customers

* Cluster 1: The customer belonging to this cluster
- Are the high spenders, infrequent buyers, who buy diverse products and also have a lot of cancellations
We can address them as Infrequent high spending buyers - try to reduce cancellations, quality control of the products sold, and reminder notifications to make them come back sooner to the platform

* Cluster 3: The customers belonging to this cluster
- Are the low-spending customers the least active ones
We can address them as almost churning customers - Throw reminder notifications on a daily basis, alluring discounts, pushing a variety low low-value products 


# Financial Loan Dashboard
This is a PowerBI project performed on a finance dataset taken from the american household.

* Uses Time Intelligence DAX functions to calculate MTD, YTD values
* Advanced and clear visulizations are used with clean labels and tooltips
* Wide range of filters available in the project
